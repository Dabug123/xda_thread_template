[*][B] What is XOSP and how was it born?[/B]
[LIST]
[*] XOSP basically which stands for the Xperia Open Source Project was a project originally created by me (@nilac) for the Galaxy S+ (my old device) and the project was created like 2 years ago when that time XOSP wasn't even existing. It was just S+ Reborn. The main idea was to create a custom minimal Xperia based ROM, by including the essential things which a user would normally use from a ROM. 
The S+ Reborn became to be a big success because it was eventually ported on different Xperia Phones and some other Samsung devices so from there the XOSP project was founded. From the XOSP Project also the Reborn add-ons were created featuring with an Aroma Installer. I worked on the project for 2 years trying always to improve it constantly, eventually for the fact that LP on my Galaxy S+ became to be quite buggy i decided to stop the development and for about half of year the project was left in standby till I decided to bring it back again on the Zenfone 2 devices. 
The project started growing again so with the Release 4 the project will be completely refactored to XOSP

[*][B] Revisions and Releases[/B]
[LIST]
[*] I've got a different type of releasing, I will not provide weekly builds but just let me show you how the revisions and release type works: The revisions refers like to a sort of Nightly thing I mean the changes included in the ROM are small not as a Release one. All the releases got 5 revisions. So the Release is something even bigger right? Hell yeah! When a new Release is released expect many improvements or new features :)
